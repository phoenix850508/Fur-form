# Fur-form

Fur-form is a small project I worked on to practice building a form from scratch. I've included a couple features for the people who are intersted in
adopting dogs from "毛小孩星球". If I have more time to practice the form, I'd also create another form for the donation part, however, before I have
more time finish to come back to add more features, I'll let this static page demonstrate that I have the ability to work on HTML/CSS(SCSS)/JavaScript 
from scratch without using bootstrap.
